# new config variables:

# if we have something in NEW_UID use that instead of 'pi'
# if we have something in NEW_GECOS use that instead of ''
# if we have something in NEW_PWD use that instead of 'raspberry'
# if we have something in NEW_ROOT_PWD use that instead of 'root'

# when PI_ZERO_OTG is non-empty:
# make an image that uses OTG Gadget USB networking by default:
# - add 'modules-load=dwc2,g_ether' to boot/cmdline.txt after 'rootwait'
# - add 'dtoverlay=dwc2' to boot/config.txt
# - make sure the file boot/ssh exists
